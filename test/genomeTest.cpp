//Tests functions of the genome.
//1) Create a named Gene with a value and drift
//2) Gene can be mutated
//3) Regulator can be named, and genes assigned to the array
//4) Genome can be defined with Regulators populated with genes
//5) Can print out descriptions of each
//6) Can mutate Regulator
//7) Can mutate Genome //Speciation event
